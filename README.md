Theater Campaign Analysis

Introduction

The Kickstarter Campaign is a collection of data from all over the word, from 2010 to 2017. This project has the aim to underline the successful campaigns in different categories.

This report, in particular, describes the data collected by the research team to create Theater Launch Datasets, to identify the best launch date for a theater campaign and  determinate the rate of success.

Method

Category filter was applied to The Kickstarter Campaign file to identify the rate of success of the theater. To deeply understand the real outcome of the Theater category, we decided to study the ‘plays” subcategory outcomes.
After this first data cleaning, we decide that the most logical way to proceder was to compare month by month the  outcomes all over the period between the years 2010-2017.
Finally we divided in different range, the goals of the companies involved in the study, this allowed us to identified how many company reached their goal.

Results

Our data suggest that 60% of the theater campaign had success,during the period between 2010 and 2017, (839 companies had successed on a total of 1393companies)while only  the 36% failed.

When the Theater category was filtered ,to have a more stringent analysis, by using the “plays” subcategory, the rate of success and failed was almost the same. 
These data confirm our previous analysis about the positive outcome of the theaters.

At this point we decide to look more deeply to understand the month by month outcome to see if there is any trend, maybe a preference season or month.
From our study results that the better period to Launch a Campaign is around May, while the fail trend is constant all over the year.

Finally, we decide to analysis the percentage of the companies that reached their own goal.
To do that we decide to divided the Goals data in 12 different range values. 
Our analysis suggest that the 70% of the companies with a goal under 1000$ and between 35 000 and 50 000$ reached their goal.

Discussion
 
This report show how in the period between the years 2010 and 2017, May looks like to be the best month to launch a Theater campaigns. 

The 75% of the companies with less then 1000$ goal reached the goal, but despite the overall success the majority of the Companies, almost the 30% failed their goal.

Unfortunately our study has some limitations due to the tools used, for examples we do not really know which types of “Plays” are really successful. 
The category and subcategory field remain very general. The understanding how to filtered the data was a challenge for this study, too much general view for something that need to be more specific.

For example:

What really mean successful campaign?

what are the button line and the upper line for fail or success?

However our data can be used as a starting point.

In a future analysis  we could increase the numbers subcategory used, by being more specific.
A new analyses can be done  by considering different factors that can influence the outcome of the different category and increase the number of the filters used ,i.e age, temperature, country
